## ✨ Features

### 1. The Vibe Radar
*   **Vibe Projection**: See your "Tomorrow State" represented as a colorful Aura. It looks at your recent energy and habits to help you prepare for the day ahead.
*   **Neural Insights**: Ever wonder exactly how much that morning Yoga session or gym trip actually affects your mood? Our AI shows you a clear percentage of how much each habit "weighs" on your happiness results.
*   **Hidden Links**: The app automatically finds connections between your habits. For example, it might discover that your sleep quality is actually tied to how often you go outside!
*   **Pattern Alerts**: If your routine suddenly changes or something unusual happens, the "Neural Forecaster" will let you know with a friendly warning so you can get back on track.

### 2. Discover Your Identity
*   **Character Archetypes**: Based on your habits, the app identifies your current "Phase." Are you a **Productive Monk** (high discipline)? A **Vibe Maximizer** (social and energetic)? Or maybe a **Neural Nomad** (exploring new routines)? Watch your character change as your habits evolve!

### 3. Gamified Growth
*   **Level Up**: Earn XP and points for staying consistent. Progress from a Level 1 beginner to a Level 10 master as you build better habits.
*   **Daily Grid**: A beautiful visual heatmap showing your performance over the month. The more you track, the more detailed your map becomes.

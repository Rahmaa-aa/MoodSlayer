## 🦾 Key Features

### 1. Neural Intelligence (The "Elite" Suite)
*   **Vibe Projection**: A custom Aura visualization that predicts your "Tomorrow State" using a sequential Neural Network.
*   **Neural Weights (XAI)**: Local Explainability engine that calculates exactly how much each habit (Gym, Mantra, etc.) is influencing your mood prediction in real-time.
*   **Synergy Radar**: Automatically detects hidden correlations between habits (e.g., how Yoga sessions might be driving your Social Battery).
*   **Anomaly Detection**: Proactive "System Glitch" alerts that trigger when your daily behavior deviates significantly from your established 30-day baseline.
*   **Vibe Archetypes**: Unsupervised clustering that categorizes your behavioral phase into personas like `PRODUCTIVE_MONK`, `VOID_DWELLER`, or `VIBE_MAXIMIZER`.
*   **Temporal Lag Logic**: Analyzes the "Memory Influence" of yesterday's actions on today's state.

### 2. Gamified Core
*   **Progressive Leveling**: Gain XP for every sync and habit completion.
*   **Streak Mechanics**: Dynamic streak calculation derived from live database entries (not static flags).
*   **Neural Unlocks**: Unlock specific dashboard capabilities as you rank up from Level 1 to Level 10.

### 3. "The Oracle" Dashboard
*   **Interactive Predictors**: Toggle specific habits to see their mathematical correlation with your "Primary Target" (Mood or any other habit).
*   **Neural Forecaster**: Real-time confidence score (Neural Stability) and status monitoring.
*   **Neural Grid**: A dense, high-fidelity historical heatmap of your daily performance.

## ✨ Features

### 1. The Vibe Radar
*   **Vibe Projection**: See your "Tomorrow State" represented as a colorful Aura. It looks at your recent energy and habits to help you prepare for the day ahead.
*   **Neural Insights**: Ever wonder exactly how much that morning Yoga session or gym trip actually affects your mood? Our AI shows you a clear percentage of how much each habit "weighs" on your happiness results.
*   **Hidden Links**: The app automatically finds connections between your habits. For example, it might discover that your sleep quality is actually tied to how often you go outside!
*   **Pattern Alerts**: If your routine suddenly changes or something unusual happens, the "Neural Forecaster" will let you know with a friendly warning so you can get back on track.

### 2. Discover Your Identity
*   **Character Archetypes**: Based on your habits, the app identifies your current "Phase." Are you a **Productive Monk** (high discipline)? A **Vibe Maximizer** (social and energetic)? Or maybe a **Neural Nomad** (exploring new routines)? Watch your character change as your habits evolve!

### 3. Gamified Growth
*   **Level Up**: Earn XP and points for staying consistent. Progress from a Level 1 beginner to a Level 10 master as you build better habits.
*   **Daily Grid**: A beautiful visual heatmap showing your performance over the month. The more you track, the more detailed your map becomes.

💎 Summary of XP/Level Logic
While we're at it, here is how the rest of your "Elite" stats work:

Logging In: +10 XP
Picking a Mood: +5 XP bonus
Tracking Habits: +2 XP for every habit you actually check off.
Leveling Up: You gain a new level for every 100 XP you earn.

+ ### 🧠 Understanding the Forecaster
+ *   **Target Prediction**: The AI's guess for how you'll feel (1.0 to 4.0) or if you'll do a habit (0% to 100%) tomorrow.
+ *   **Neural Stability**: How "sure" the AI is. High stability (90%+) means the AI has detected a very strong, reliable pattern in your life.
+ *   **Status**: "NOMINAL" means the system is healthy and has enough data to be trusted.

1. target_prediction: 0.97 (or 3.73)
This is the AI's "Forecast" for tomorrow.

For Mood: If you are tracking "Overall Mood," it scales to your 1–4 range. A 3.73 means the AI thinks you are going to have a near-perfect "Happy" day tomorrow based on what you've done lately.
For Habits: If you select a habit (like "Gym"), a 0.97 means the AI is 97% certain you will complete that habit tomorrow.
2. > neural_stability: 99%
Think of this as the AI's Confidence Score.

99% means the AI has a lot of history to look at and its internal "math" is fitting your patterns almost perfectly. It "knows" you very well.
Lower scores (e.g. 40%) happen when you change your routine suddenly or don't have enough days logged yet. The AI is basically saying, "I'm still learning your rhythm, so don't 100% bet on my prediction yet."
3. > status: NOMINAL
This is a quick "Health Check" status:

🟢 NOMINAL: Everything is perfect. The AI has enough data and a stable model.
🟡 COLD_START_RESTRICTION: You haven't logged enough days yet (usually less than 15-20 days). The AI is giving you a prediction, but it's labeling it as a "beginner guess."

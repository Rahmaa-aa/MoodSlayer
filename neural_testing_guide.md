## 👥 Persona DNA & Testing Goals

### 1. The Stoic Monk (`monk@mood.com`)
*   **Behavioral DNA**: 30 days of 100% consistency. High Gym, High Mantra, Zero Rotting.
*   **Testing Goal**: Model Peak Accuracy.
*   **What to expect**: 
    - **Neural Stability**: Should be **90-100%**.
    - **Vibe Projection**: Should consistently predict **HAPPY** or **REVOLUTIONARY**.
    - **Oracle**: Will show very high positive correlations for Yoga/Mantra.
    - **Archetype**: Should display **PRODUCTIVE_MONK**.

### 2. Chaos Agent (`chaos@mood.com`)
*   **Behavioral DNA**: Complete entropy. Random inputs for every field.
*   **Testing Goal**: System Stress & Confidence Management.
*   **What to expect**:
    - **Neural Stability**: Should be low (**<30%**).
    - **Status**: Should show **COLD_START_RESTRICTION** or **UNCERTAIN**.
    - **Oracle**: Bars will be erratic and low strength.
    - **Aura**: Will fluctuate wildly between colors.

### 3. Weekend Warrior (`warrior@mood.com`)
*   **Behavioral DNA**: 5 days of "Sad Gym-goer" followed by 2 days of "Happy Rotter".
*   **Testing Goal**: Temporal Lag Recognition.
*   **What to expect**:
    - **Oracle**: Look specifically for **YESTERDAY'S_ROTTING_TIME**. It should show a high positive correlation with Mood, as the "Happy" phase happens *after* the rot.
    - **Synergy Radar**: May detect a link between Gym (weekday) and lack of Rotting.

### 4. Glitch Entity (`glitch@mood.com`)
*   **Behavioral DNA**: 20 days of perfect routine, followed by a sudden 7-day collapse into high rotting and zero activities.
*   **Testing Goal**: Anomaly Detection.
*   **What to expect**:
    - **System Alert**: You should see a **[SYSTEM_GLITCH_DETECTED]** alert in the Neural Forecaster.
    - **Severity**: Should indicate **CRITICAL** deviation for "Rotting Time".
    - **Oracle**: Will begin shifting weights significantly as it tries to reconcile the new "bad" pattern.

### 5. Vibe Shifter (`shifter@mood.com`)
*   **Behavioral DNA**: Phase 1 (15 days) is Sad/Yoga. Phase 2 (15 days) is Happy/Gym.
*   **Testing Goal**: Archetype Clustering.
*   **What to expect**:
    - **Archetype Label**: Log in and observe the top-right corner of the Vibe card. 
    - **Shifting Logic**: As you add a few more "Happy/Gym" days, watch the label transition from **NEURAL_NOMAD** to **VIBE_MAXIMIZER**.

## 🛠️ How to Test
1.  **Login**: Use the emails above with password `password123`.
2.  **Navigate**: Go to the `/cycles` page.
3.  **Interact**: Toggle the **Selected Predictors** checkboxes. Observe how the **Neural Weights** (black badges) in the Oracle update instantly to explain the current prediction.
4.  **Verify**: Log a new entry with the new **RATING** type (e.g. Pain Level) and watch the AI incorporate it into the next analysis cycle.
